# CNN-Based-Classification-of-Dog-vs-Cat
Convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of artificial neural network that is commonly used in image recognition and other tasks that involve processing pixel data. CNNs are able to learn to identify patterns in images by applying a series of filters to the data.

## As I have created a basic CNN model for classifying cats and dogs. it is a basic model build in Colab and uses the Kaggle dataset.
## Image manipulation 
It is the process of changing or altering an image. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to improve the appearance of an image, to remove unwanted objects or artifacts, or to create new images from existing ones. There are many different techniques that can be used to manipulate images, including cropping, resizing, rotating, adjusting colors, and adding filters.
## Creating more images for training 
It is a common practice in machine learning, and it is especially important for CNNs. This is because CNNs need a large dataset of images in order to learn to identify patterns. If the dataset is too small, the CNN may not be able to learn to classify images accurately. There are a number of ways to create more images for training, such as:
### Augmenting existing images.
This involves applying a variety of transformations to existing images, such as cropping, resizing, rotating, and flipping. This can help to create a more diverse dataset that can help the CNN to learn to identify a wider range of patterns.
### Generating new images.
This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as GANs (generative adversarial networks). GANs are able to generate new images that are similar to real images. This can be a useful way to create a large dataset of images for training, especially if it is difficult or expensive to collect real images.

#### As it is just a basic model we can make it much better later
